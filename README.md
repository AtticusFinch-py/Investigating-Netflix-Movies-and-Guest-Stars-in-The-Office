## Netflix Data Analysis with Python

This project involves analyzing Netflix data using Python and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. The goal is to explore trends in movie durations over the years and investigate the impact of different genres on movie lengths.

## Project Overview

1. **Loading and Preparing Data:**
   - Loaded Netflix data into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Created a dictionary and DataFrame to analyze average movie durations from 2011 to 2020.

2. **Visualizing Data:**
   - Utilized matplotlib to create line plots and scatter plots for visualizing movie durations over time.
   - Explored the relationship between release year and movie duration.

3. **Data Filtering:**
   - Filtered the dataset to include only movies.
   - Selected relevant columns for analysis (title, country, genre, release year, and duration).

4. **Genre Analysis:**
   - Identified genres affecting the average duration of movies.
   - Plotted a scatter plot with different colors for genres like Children, Documentaries, and Stand-Up.

5. **Insights:**
   - Discovered that non-typical genres, such as Children and Documentaries, tend to have shorter durations.
   - Explored the possibility of other factors influencing the average duration of movies.
